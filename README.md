# Iris-Classification-Using-kNN
The main goal of this project is to use machine learning (k Nearest Neighbor algorithm) to predict the species of the iris flowers given a set of features. The data description is presented in the data profile section. This is a three-class classification problem because the flowers have three species namely: setosa, versicolour, and virginica.

# Data
This famous (Fisher's or Anderson's) iris data set gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
iris is a data frame with 150 cases (rows) and 5 variables (columns) named Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width, and Species.
